# Nofu Bot v3.4 is here!

After a few days of trying around theres one new feature making the difference.

Use `%activity` to show all activity types
  

# Commands

Here a few examples of what the bot can do:

- %password will generate a completely random password and send it to you via direct messages

  

- %findsongs will send you a list of all songs the bot found (Of course via direct messages to avoid chat spam)

  

- %meme will send you a juicy meme from nowhere other than r/memes

  

- %findanime will list some informations like characters and number of episodes about the given anime.

## Vc-Commands [Experimental]

Yes, I've added vc-commands.

Just join a vc, type %nut or %e, enjoy.
