# Nofu Bot v3.3.7
New features and minor code improvements.
- Added the quiz command - %quiz <topic>
- Broadcasts are now a thing, if you want to get broadcasts made by the developer, create a channel that includes "broadcast" in its name!:D 

# Upcoming
<b>Nofu Bot v3.4</b>

Ladies and gents, I'm back with the newest version of the Bot being released the next few days.

Things which are going to be added:
- I'm TRYING, to add slash commands, so you dont have to type it all out!
- A complete code revamp for a bit faster execution.

# Commands
Here a few examples of what the bot can do:
- %password will generate a completely random password and send it to you via direct messages

- %findsongs will send you a list of all songs the bot found (Of course via direct messages to avoid chat spam)

- %meme will send you a juicy meme from nowhere other than r/memes

- %findanime will list some informations like characters and number of episodes about the given anime.
## Vc-Commands [Experimental]
Yes, I've added vc-commands.
Just join a vc, type %nut or %e, enjoy.
