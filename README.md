# The Nofu Bot


# 🤔 So what can it do?

In short: It can entertain people :D

With the usage of
- %meme
- %mememan
- %joke

You can make the bot send some *juicy* memes from
r/meme, r/mememan and you can make it send (bad 🤨) jokes :p

# 🔨 Utility
So, is it able to do useful stuff?
Yes!

with
- %ping
- %userinfo
- %serverinfo
- %delete
- %password

- %convert
- %findanime

You can actually
- Test your connection to the server the command was used in
- Get your own userinfo OR some user's info by simply mentioning (@) them!
- Get some infos about the server the command was used in
- delete the given amount of messages
- make a generated and safe password slide right into your dms :>

- provide a link direct to an image and it will be converted to the given file type!
- search an anime name and see infos about it!
